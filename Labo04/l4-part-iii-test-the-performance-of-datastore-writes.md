# L4 - Part III - Test the performance of datastore writes

* For each performance test copy a screenshot of the JMeter **Graph Results** listener and the App Engine **Dashboard** view into the report.

```
//TODO
```

* What response times do you observe in the test tool for each Servlet?

```
//TODO
```

* Compare the response times shown by the test tool and the App Engine console. Explain the difference

```
//TODO
```

* How many resources have you used to run these tests? From the **Quota Details** view of the console determine the non-zero resource quotas (**Daily quota** different from 0%). Explain each with a sentence. To get a sense of everything measured, click on **Show resources not in use**.

```
//TODO
```

* Suppose you become suspicious that the algorithm for the automatic scaling of instances is not working correctly. Imagine a way in which the algorithm could be broken. Which measures shown in the console would you use to detect this failure?

```
//TODO
```
